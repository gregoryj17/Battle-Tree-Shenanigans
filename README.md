This is some project I made back in early 2017 to compile statistics about the various Pokemon you may encounter in battle in the Battle Tree in Pokemon Sun and Moon. The data was gathered from serebii.net.

It has been long enough that I forget most of what I did here but I know the Python script was to parse one of the text files by stripping special characters and then the Java code created the data in the "data" folder.
